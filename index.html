Let's use them in an innovative way. Eventeeo is a mobile application developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/michalwojtysiak" target="_blank">Michał Wojtysiak</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/paciej00" target="_blank">Maciej Piotrowski</a> and me. Prepared for the <a href="http://bihapi.pl/" target="_blank">BIHAPI</a> competition it is a mobile application which allows to find interesting events taking place in the city of Poznań while in the same time gathering a lot of interesting data about users' preferences. The idea is that when bored on Saturday afternoon one wants to find something interesting to do but does not have a precise idea in mind. Therefore, instead of presenting a full list of events to the user and letting them browse Eventeeo presents only one event at the time to get user's full attention and only after they decide whether it is interesting for them or not they can see the next one. With time we could learn user profiles, suggest more relevant events and learn a lot about city inhabitants.</div></div>

The task was to create a visualization which will give the answer for the question on how to target a mobile application markating campaign. As I am not an online marketing expert I have decided to create a rather exploratory tool which will allow the experts to find the groups of the potential customers i.e. those who will be most likely to respond positively to the campaign. To do that I have created an interactive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping" target="_blank">treemap</a> which partitions all the users into subgroups and for each displays the value of a chosen metric e.g. average donation per user. Now, the domain expert can experiment with different partitions of the customers into subgroups and easily spot interesting ones. Code of the project is open sourced and published on GitHub.</div></div>

I really like the idea as I agree that for networks with many nodes and connections it can give much more insights into the data compared to other 'hair ball' styled layouts e.g. force directed. Moreover, I teamed up with <a href="http://www.luke-photography.com/" target="_blank">Lukasz Gajdek</a> - a very good friend of mine who deals with digital media on a daily basis and while I took charge of the tedious work of data cleaning and preparation, he made sure that the final result is really pleasant to look at. In the final stage some scripting was added to make the experience interactive et voila.</div></div>

This simple application is hosted in the <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">cloud</a> and exploits many different components to collect and analyze tweets about fashion. Therefore, it can be seen as a social media monitoring tool which attempts to find useful information such as patterns or anomalies in the mass of unstructured text which people publish online. Although the analysis performed is rather simple the results are interesting and many further improvements can be considered e.g. deeper linguistic or sentiment analysis of the tweets and more complex analysis of the collected data.</div></div>

		<div class="entry" data-tags="project,js,webdev,d3,vis"><div class="window"><div class="overlay"><a href="#" class="tag">Project</a><a href="#" class="tag">Java Script</a><a href="#" class="tag">Web Development</a><a href="#" class="tag">D3.js</a><a href="#" class="tag">Visualization</a><br><br><br><a href="http://open.xerox.com/" target="_blank" class="tag">See the project</a></div><div class="buttons" style="background: #E4E2D6 url(content/img/ox_small.png) no-repeat top left"></div></div><div class="title-bar"><h1>Visualization for Open Xerox</h1></div><div class="description" style="display: none;">The advent of modern web browsers and open web standards helps to abandon proprietary plugins and allows to create fully interactive content in the browser using open source technologies and standards. That, in the times of information overload leads to the popularization of the visualization tools which give efficient and elegant way for presenting and understanding data. During the internship which was a part of my master programme I had a chance to work in Xerox Research Centre Europe in France and develop a visualization framework which operates on top of the Open Xerox web platform. The framework was constructed using Java Script and <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> library and is publicly available on <a href="http://open.xerox.com/" target="_blank">Open Xerox</a> (only for registered users).</div></div>

The task of the first visualization competition was to gain insights into a daily deals industry (e.g. Groupon, LivingSocial) in a quick yet intuitive manner. Visualization techniques are often the very first step in the process of data analysis allowing to expose the structure of the dataset and form hypotheses which should be later veryfied using more sohisticated statistucal approaches. My interactive submission created using <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> library and Java Script was placed amongst top 10 winning participants and also received a special price for the most creative submission.</div></div>

Mind mapping techniques appeared particularly interesting however static images seemed to be boring and were not able to convey the dynamic multimedia content. Therefore, I have developed an interactive version of the Curriculum Vitae using Adobe Flash technology to display my resume in a form of a mind map. Mind maps are diagrams allowing to take notes and organize information in a nonlinear way and to outline it visually which is supposed to ease the process of memorization. This idea proved to be successful in attracting potential employers and winning a chance to get interviews as well as <a href="http://www.em-dmkm.eu/" target="_blank">Erasmus Mundus DMKM</a> master program scholarship. Project is no longer supported; my up-to-date CV can be found <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></div></div>

One of them, done together with a friend of mine Łukasz Lyszczarz was "Big boys fun time" (original title "Męskie zabawy"). The film tells a story about a war and irresponsible men who treat their soldiers, as if they were toys. And the conflict goes on even after the war is over...<br><br>This animation was done using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion" target="_blank">stop-motion</a> technique mixed with shots of real actors. It received several prizes on local polish film festivals e.g. <a href="http://www.mmpoznan.pl/314238/festiwal-kino-cisnien-klej-najlepszy" target="_blank">Kino Ciśnień</a> or <a href="http://www.tarnow.pl/Kultura/Aktualnosci-kulturalne/Zwyciezcy-27-Miedzynarodowego-Festiwalu-Filmowego-Dozwolone-do-21" target="_blank">Dozwolone do 21</a>.</div></div>
