	<div class="entry" data-tags="project,js,d3,vis"><div class="window"><div class="overlay"><a href="#" class="tag">Project</a><a href="#" class="tag">Java Script</a><a href="#" class="tag">D3.js</a><a href="#" class="tag">Visualization</a><br><br><br><a href="/projects/flights/" target="_blank" class="tag">See the project</a></div><div class="buttons" style="background: #E4E2D6 url(content/img/flights.png) no-repeat top left"></div></div><div class="title-bar"><h1>Air traffic visualization</h1></div><div class="description" style="display: none;"><a href="http://neo4j.com/showmeyourgraph-rules/">Neo4j #ShowMeYourGraph Twitter Contest</a> was my main motivation and a great reason behind many hours spent on experimenting and testing my skills and patience while working with the hive plot. <a href="http://www.hiveplot.net/">Hive plot</a> is a special graph layout by <a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/">Martin Krzywinski</a> which attempts to position the nodes in a meaningful way which can be interpreted. I really like the idea as I agree that for networks with many nodes and connections it can give much more insights into the data compared to other 'hair ball' styled layouts e.g. force directed. Moreover, I teamed up with <a href="http://www.luke-photography.com/">Lukasz Gajdek</a> - a very good friend of mine who deals with digital media on a daily basis and while I took charge of the tedious work of data cleaning and preparation, he made sure that the final result is really pleasant to look at. In the final stage some scripting was added to make the experience interactive et voila.</div></div>

This simple application is hosted in the <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">cloud</a> and exploits many different components to collect and analyze tweets about fashion. Therefore, it can be seen as a social media monitoring tool which attempts to find useful information such as patterns or anomalies in the mass of unstructured text which people publish online. Although the analysis performed is rather simple the results are interesting and many further improvements can be considered e.g. deeper linguistic or sentiment analysis of the tweets and more complex analysis of the collected data.</div></div>

	<div class="entry" data-tags="project,js,webdev,d3,vis"><div class="window"><div class="overlay"><a href="#" class="tag">Project</a><a href="#" class="tag">Java Script</a><a href="#" class="tag">Web Development</a><a href="#" class="tag">D3.js</a><a href="#" class="tag">Visualization</a><br><br><br><a href="http://open.xerox.com/" target="_blank" class="tag">See the project</a></div><div class="buttons" style="background: #E4E2D6 url(content/img/ox_small.png) no-repeat top left"></div></div><div class="title-bar"><h1>Visualization for Open Xerox</h1></div><div class="description" style="display: none;">The advent of modern web browsers and open web standards helps to abandon proprietary plugins and allows to create fully interactive content in the browser using open source technologies and standards. That, in the times of information overload leads to the popularization of the visualization tools which give efficient and elegant way for presenting and understanding data. During the internship which was a part of my master programme I had a chance to work in Xerox Research Cetnre Europe in France and develop a visualization framework which operates on top of the Open Xerox web platform. The framework was constructed using Java Script and <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> library and is publicly available on <a href="http://open.xerox.com/" target="_blank">Open Xerox</a>.</div></div>

The task of the first visualization competition was to gain insights into a daily deals industry (e.g. Groupon, LivingSocial) in a quick yet intuitive manner. Visualization techniques are often the very first step in the process of data analysis allowing to expose the structure of the dataset and form hypotheses which should be later veryfied using more sohisticated statistucal approaches. My interactive submission created using <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> library and Java Script was placed amongst top 10 winning participants and also received a special price for the most creative submission.</div></div>

	<div class="entry" data-tags="aboutme,project,cv,flash,vis"><div class="window"><div class="overlay"><a href="#" class="tag">About me</a><a href="#" class="tag">Project</a><a href="#" class="tag">Resume / CV</a><a href="#" class="tag">Flash</a><a href="#" class="tag">Visualization</a><br><br><br><a href="/projects/cv/" target="_blank" class="tag">See the project</a></div><div class="buttons" style="background: #E4E2D6 url(content/img/cv_min.png) no-repeat top left"></div></div><div class="title-bar"><h1>Interactive CV</h1></div><div class="description" style="display: none;">The idea originated while exploring different alternative ways of presenting a resume. Mind mapping techniques appeared particularly interesting however static images seemed to be boring and were not able to convey the dynamic multimedia content. Therefore, I have developed an interactive version of the Curriculum Vitae using Adobe Flash technology to display my resume in a form of a mind map. Mind maps are diagrams allowing to take notes and organize information in a nonlinear way and to outline it visually which is supposed to ease the process of memorization. This idea proved to be successful in attracting potential employers and winning a chance to get interviews as well as <a href="http://www.em-dmkm.eu/" target="_blank">Erasmus Mundus DMKM</a> master programme scholarship.</div></div>
